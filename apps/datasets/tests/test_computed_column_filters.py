"""Filters must apply to COMPUTED (annotated) dataset columns.

Downstream-reported: a plain filter on a computed column — `?hours_band=business`,
`?route=on_call`, `?answered=1` — was silently ignored and returned **every row**.
`_apply_list_filters` resolved every declared filter name with
`model._meta.get_field()` and `continue`d when that raised, so an annotation
(which is a real column on the queryset, just not on the model) was dropped.

That is the dangerous failure mode for an analytical surface: no error, no empty
result — a tile labelled "business hours" quietly showing *all* hours. It also
broke a documented promise: "Every operation works on a computed dataset"
(docs/skills/datasets.md) and the filter invariant that rows/series/scalar all
honour the same `{name: scalar}` contract.

The pipeline now consults `qs.query.annotations` before giving up, and types the
comparison from the annotation's `output_field`.
