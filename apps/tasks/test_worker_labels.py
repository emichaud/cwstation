"""Every shipped worker launch site must pass a readable `--worker-id` label.

Downstream-reported from a production migration: the inline worker in
`docker-entrypoint.sh` passed no `--worker-id`, so upstream's 32-char random
default became the label and the heartbeat table read
`oxp0RB1Z85F7X4yFX7IO8Vc1kAedLTER#a1b2c3…` — which tells an operator nothing
about which process that is.

A stable label is *safe* (and has been since v0.23.0): `db_worker` mints a
per-process incarnation `<label>#<token>` and gives that to the queue, so
reusing one label across restarts can't make a dead predecessor's abandoned
task look live. See `TestWorkerIncarnation` in test_reaper.py for that
guarantee — this file only guards that the shipped deployment files actually
take advantage of it.

Why a file-content test: these are shell and YAML, so nothing imports them and
no unit test executes them. A flag dropped during an unrelated edit would
silently restore the unreadable default, and the only symptom would be a
heartbeat table nobody can read — months later, in production.
