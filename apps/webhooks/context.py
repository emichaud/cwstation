"""Loop guard — thread-local outbound suppression + the delivery origin.

The outbound event source is a global ``post_save``/``post_delete`` observer with no
origin discrimination, so a handler (or a paired SmallStack) that writes back into a
``enable_webhooks`` model re-triggers the event and can run away (reproduced 1→6 in the
n8n scenario, F-020). Two primitives break the loop:

* :func:`suppress_webhooks` — a re-entrant thread-local context manager. Writes made
  inside it emit **no** outbound events. Inbound dispatch runs each handler inside it by
  default (see :func:`apps.webhooks.registry.get_handler`), so a naive write-back can't
  echo. A handler that *wants* to cascade opts out with ``cascade=True``.

* :func:`current_origin` / the ``X-SmallStack-Origin`` header — every delivery is stamped
  with this SmallStack's origin so a receiver can drop self-originated events
  (``WebhookReceiver.ignore_origin``), closing a two-way S2S link.

Thread-local (not a plain module global) so a suppression on one worker thread never
leaks into a concurrently-served request on another. Best-effort by design: if something
about the guard misbehaves it must fail *open* (still deliver) rather than silently drop
real events — so :func:`suppressed` is a simple boolean read with a safe default.
